**bblocks** is a python package with tools to download and analyse development data. These tools are
meant to be the _building blocks_ of further analysis.

**bblocks** is currently in active development. Functionality and APIs are very likely to change. We welcome feedback,
feature requests, and collaboration. We hope that this will be a valuable resource for organisations working with
sustainable development data.
