The bblocks package
===================


**bblocks** is a python package with tools to download and analyse
development data. These tools are meant to be the *building blocks* of
further analysis.

**bblocks** is currently in active development. Functionality and APIs
are very likely to change. We welcome feedback, feature requests, and
collaboration. We hope that this will be a valuable resource for
organisations working with sustainable development data.
