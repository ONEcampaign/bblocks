# Getting Started

Itâ€™s easy to get started with `bblocks`.
Whether you want the full distribution or only specific tools, installation is flexible 
and straightforward.

## Installation

You can install:

- The entire bblocks toolkit (recommended for full functionality)
- Individual packages, if you only need certain tools
- Multiple selected packages, using optional extras

```bash title="Install the full bblocks toolkit"
pip install bblocks # (1)!
```

1.  Using `bblocks[all]` works too 


```bash title="Install specific packages"
pip install bblocks-data-importers
```

```bash title="Install multiple packages with optional extras"
pip install bblocks[data-importers] # (1)!
```

1.  All bblocks packages are modular, so you only install what you need. This keeps your environment lean 
and efficient. The available packages are:
    - `bblocks-data-importers`
    - `bblocks-places`
    - `bblocks-data-analysis`
    - `bblocks-datacommons-tools`
