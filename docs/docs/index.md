# `bblocks`

<h2>Building Blocks for development data work </h2>

`bblocks` is a growing collection of Python packages designed to simplify the everyday work of 
analysts and researchers in the international development sector. Built with usability and 
modularity in mind, `bblocks` provides reliable, reusable components that help standardize and 
streamline data workflows—from data cleaning and transformation to country concordance, 
dataset importation, and integration with ETL pipelines such as [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/).

Whether you're wrangling data for a quick analysis or developing a robust, production-ready
pipeline, `bblocks` offers practical, tested tools that are easy to plug into your workflow and 
scale with your needs.

## Why `bblocks`?

In international development data teams, it’s common to face the same challenges again and again:

- Harmonizing country and region names
- Cleaning inconsistently formatted data 
- Fetching public datasets
- Validating data before publication or use

Too often, these solutions are hidden in personal scripts or scattered across notebooks, making them hard to maintain, 
reuse, or share across teams. `bblocks` was built to change that. It brings these common utilities into one 
well-structured, tested, and reusable ecosystem of packages.
What does `bblocks` offer?

🔁 __Consistency__ — Shared methods and standards across teams and projects


⚡ __Efficiency__ — Save time by avoiding repetitive coding tasks


🔧 __Maintainability__ — Centralized improvements benefit all users instantly


📈 __Scalability__ — Suitable for quick analysis or production-level pipelines


By turning one-off scripts into durable components, `bblocks` helps you build a cleaner, more reliable data foundation 
for all your work.
